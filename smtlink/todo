1. SMT-function and SMT-translator have termination problem
2. how to arrage the files, include and certify books?

;; ====================================================
When replacing part of the formula with the let expression,
there are several places the replacement can occur:
before the expansion, while the expansion and after the
expassion.

After the expansion make sense because functions defined
by user can have terms that requires user simplification.
And before the expansion also kind of make sense because
it guides ACL2 to prove some given properties first and
then this result may help prove the theorem. During the
expansion may make sense too, and it can be cool, but we
are just not so sure how to control that kind of rewriting.
It can be convenient that part of the expansion is
rewritten and part of it is not, and this is a better way
to guide ACL2.

So temporarily, we'll rewrite the formula before and after
the expansion. No other time.

;; ===================================================

I'm not supporting recognizing lambda expression for let
expressions. The reason is that, it's kind of weird that
the user would think about what the expansion is like and
take something spanning two function expansions as some
hint hypothesis. It could be possible, but weird. And the
implementation can be really tough. I can ask Mark this
question tomorrow.

-- actually, I think I can solve the problem by expanding
   the let-expression's functions. ... tomorrow ... nope..
   this is not a problem...

do we want type for hypothesis variables?
helper.lisp : append-and-decl and append-and-hyp needs to
combine. Need type information

variable names in lisp, if has dashes, won't work in z3!!!!

When giving new hypotheses, the format is not in the underneath
form. I don't really want to user to figure out the form.
How to do that?

I need to solve above three problems today!

05/16
(let (...) clause) -- not working
I tried it in the command, cannot prove......
done!

05/17
(let (...) clause) done
new hypotheses done
variable name?
type inference?
