Todo list:
  2 1. minor changes to translation and see if it will work - hot
  3 2. reform the SMT-formula and translate-SMT-formula programs into cleaner version
  4 3. check if there's a type mismatch in if-statement in ACL2
  5 4. add argument length to my associated list
  6 5. generate a bunch of test cases and run them -- good if there are function definitions
