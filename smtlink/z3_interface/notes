1. abstract parameters away
2. clause processor, how to certify
3. How to expand my proof so that it will be able to solve any nonlinear discrete dynamic systems, a recurrence model. Or even a continuous model?
The input should be: a recurrence model - is there a better way so I can scale that?

Problems that make it hard to scale:
1. I have to derive the sum by hand...
2. We pair up points and manually look at the terms to determine positive or negative properties...
3. ... what about this:
   prove there exist an integer number n that from any starting point, the points gets closer to the middle region within that number of steps
   could be possible?
