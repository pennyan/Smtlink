A list of todos after submitting the paper:

Easy todos:
(The paper is written assuming these changes as it simplifies the representation)
1. Write gen_config.py script for generating the configuration file.
2. Return the result of type predicates back to ACL2.

More involved todos:
(The paper is written assuming these changes has not been made.
 We will update the final version of the paper to match the Smtlink at that time.
 We will happily consider suggestions for improvements from the reviewers or
 others.)
1. Fulfill the XDOC for Smtlink, add a tutorial
2. Simplify function expansion.


=====================================================================
Bugs:
1. (15 / 6) should be translated into Q(15,6) instead of a reciprocal
   becaues that will be 2.
   This makes me feel worried because:
       In Z3, a = Int('a'), prove(Implies(a >= 1, 4/(a*5) == 0)) => proved!!!!!
       In ACL2, integer division are by default taken as rationals, so that's not a theorem in ACL2.
